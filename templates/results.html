            <h4>Causes</h4>
            {% if class_name == "AKIEC" %}
            <p>Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma are skin lesions caused by excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun or tanning beds. These lesions are precancerous and can develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "BCC" %}
            <p>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a type of skin cancer that forms in the basal cells of your skin. It looks like a small, sometimes shiny bump or scaly flat patch on your skin that slowly grows over time. BCC can affect anyone but it's slightly more common among men and people assigned male at birth. It occurs more often in people older than 50 years. People with fair skin and light eyes are more likely to get BCC.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "BKL" %}
            <p>Benign keratosis-like lesions are non-cancerous skin growths that can be caused by various factors, such as aging, sun exposure, and genetic predisposition. They are generally harmless but can sometimes resemble more serious skin conditions.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "DF" %}
            <p>Dermatofibromas are benign skin growths that typically develop as firm, reddish-brown bumps on the legs, arms, or trunk. They are believed to be caused by minor trauma or injury to the skin, such as insect bites or scratches.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "MEL" %}
            <p>Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. It can spread to other parts of the body and can be life-threatening if not detected and treated early. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun or tanning beds is a major risk factor for melanoma.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "NV" %}
            <p>Melanocytic nevi, commonly known as moles, are benign growths on the skin that are formed by clusters of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. They are generally harmless but should be monitored for any changes in appearance or size, as some moles can develop into melanoma.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "VASC" %}
            <p>Vascular lesions are abnormal growths or malformations of blood vessels in the skin. They can be caused by various factors, such as genetic disorders, trauma, or underlying medical conditions. Some common types include angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas, and hemorrhages.</p>
            {% else %}
            <p>Information about the causes of this condition is not available.</p>
            {% endif %}
            <h4>Treatment</h4>
            {% if class_name == "AKIEC" %}
            <p>Treatment options for actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma may include cryotherapy (freezing), topical chemotherapy creams, photodynamic therapy, or surgical removal, depending on the severity and location of the lesions.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "BCC" %}
            <p>Your provider will treat basal cell carcinoma by removing cancer from your body. Treatment options could include electrodessication and curettage, surgery, cryotherapy or cryosurgery, chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and laser therapy. The best treatment option will be chosen based on your overall health, age, the location of the cancer, and the size of the BCC.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "BKL" %}
            <p>Benign keratosis-like lesions generally do not require treatment unless they are bothersome or cosmetically concerning. In such cases, treatment options may include cryotherapy, electrodessication, or surgical removal.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "DF" %}
            <p>Dermatofibromas do not typically require treatment unless they are causing discomfort or cosmetic concerns. If treatment is desired, options may include surgical excision, cryotherapy, or intralesional corticosteroid injections.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "MEL" %}
            <p>Melanoma treatment depends on the stage and extent of the cancer. Early-stage melanoma may be treated with surgical removal, while more advanced cases may require additional treatments such as immunotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "NV" %}
            <p>Melanocytic nevi (moles) generally do not require treatment unless they show signs of abnormal changes or cancer development. In such cases, surgical removal or regular monitoring may be recommended.</p>
            {% elif class_name == "VASC" %}
            <p>Treatment for vascular lesions depends on the type and severity of the lesion. Options may include laser therapy, sclerotherapy, surgical removal, or topical or systemic medications, depending on the specific condition.</p>
            {% else %}
            <p>Information about the treatment of this condition is not available.</p>
